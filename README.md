# Overview

Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) are promising technologies for clean hydrogen energy conversion.
However, improving PEMFC performance and durability requires a deep understanding of the complex interaction between:

- Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) properties
- Catalyst characteristics
- Operating conditions
- Electrochemical losses
- Long-term degradation mechanisms


This repository presents my work on three major projects for PEMFC development:


**1. Understanding MEA behavior through experimental electrochemical data analysis**

**2. Predicting and optimizing fuel cell performance using Machine learning models**

**3. Modeling degradation behavior and estimating fuel cell lifetime using Deep leaning, time series (ARIMA, SARIMA, GRU,,+ RNN, LSTM)**


The projects represent different stages of PEMFC engineering development, from laboratory characterization 
to predictive modeling.
