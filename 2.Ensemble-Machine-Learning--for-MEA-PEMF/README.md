## Overview

Designing high-performance **Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs)** for 
**Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs)** traditionally relies on expensive and 
time-consuming experimental trial-and-error.

The objective is to replace traditional trial-and-error experimental approaches with
data-driven models capable of:

- Predicting fuel cell performance metrics such as maximum power density (MPD).
- Identifying critical catalyst and MEA design parameters.
- Understanding relationships between material properties and electrochemical performance.
- Supporting accelerated catalyst and MEA development.

Fuel cell development involves complex interactions between catalyst materials, synthesis
methods, electrode structures, and operating conditions. Machine learning provides a pathway
to extract hidden patterns from large experimental datasets and guide future material design.
